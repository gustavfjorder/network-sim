Should we have the packet in the link for a while?
Are links in both directions?
Are hosts connected to just one router?
Buffer of router?
Loss in links?
Link propagation: https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/latency.html
Time as integers (microsecond) or floats (seconds)?
Router receives and sends and processes at the same time? 
Do we account for the time it takes to send/receive a packet (like receceiver getting it, putting it in the buffer, and then sending again)?
Can there be two flows from the same source?
